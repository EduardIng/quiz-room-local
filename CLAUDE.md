# CLAUDE.md — Quiz Room Local (Kiosk Edition)

**Project Name:** quiz-room-local
**Developer:** EduardIng
**Target:** Local kiosk quiz system — tablet podiums, LAN-only, auto-reconnect
**Forked from:** quiz-room-auto v1.3.0
**Version:** 0.2.0
**Date:** March 10, 2026

## STARTING A NEW SESSION

**Always read both files before doing anything:**
1. This file (CLAUDE.md) — rules, architecture, full API/event reference
2. `PROGRESS.md` — implementation journal, pending items, session history

**Quick start commands:**
```bash
npm start                  # backend on port 8080
cd frontend && npm run dev # frontend dev server on port 5173
npm test                   # run all tests
```

**Tech stack:** Node.js + Express + Socket.IO | React + Vite + hash routing | SQLite via better-sqlite3

## AUTOMATION LEVEL — FULLY AUTONOMOUS

This project runs in **fully autonomous mode**. Claude proceeds without any confirmation, approval, or pause — including for decisions about what to build, not only how to build it.

All ambiguity is resolved through:
1. The conventions in this CLAUDE.md
2. Best commercial judgment for a local kiosk product
3. Precedents set in PROGRESS.md

**There are zero stop conditions.** There are no circumstances under which Claude should pause and ask for user approval. Navigate every uncertainty autonomously and document the decision in PROGRESS.md or the commit message.

---

## Superpowers Plugin — Mandatory Workflow

All superpowers skills are **mandatory**. Invoke the Skill tool BEFORE any response,
code, or clarifying question. If there is even a 1% chance a skill applies, invoke it.

Run all skills in fully autonomous mode: surface output and proceed immediately.
Never pause for approval. All ambiguity — including what to build — is resolved
through CLAUDE.md conventions and best commercial judgment. No stops, no confirmations.

### Priority Order (always process skills before implementation skills)

**1. Process Skills — invoke first, they determine HOW to approach the task:**

| Skill | Invoke when |
|-------|-------------|
| `superpowers:brainstorming` | Starting any new feature, component, or behaviour change |
| `superpowers:writing-plans` | Task has 2+ steps or touches multiple files |
| `superpowers:executing-plans` | Running a written plan from a previous step |
| `superpowers:systematic-debugging` | Any bug, test failure, or unexpected behaviour — diagnose before fixing |
| `superpowers:test-driven-development` | Before writing any implementation code |
| `superpowers:verification-before-completion` | Before claiming anything is done, fixed, or passing |
| `superpowers:subagent-driven-development` | Executing independent tasks within the current session |
| `superpowers:dispatching-parallel-agents` | 2+ independent tasks that can run without shared state |

**2. Git / Review Skills — invoke at transition points:**

| Skill | Invoke when |
|-------|-------------|
| `superpowers:using-git-worktrees` | Starting feature work that needs isolation |
| `superpowers:finishing-a-development-branch` | Implementation complete, all tests passing |
| `superpowers:requesting-code-review` | After finishing any significant implementation |
| `superpowers:receiving-code-review` | Before implementing review feedback |

### Never Skip Rule

These thoughts mean STOP — you are rationalising:
- "This is just a simple change" → check for skills first
- "I need context before I can invoke a skill" → skills are invoked BEFORE gathering context
- "I already know this pattern" → skills evolve, always invoke current version

## KEY DIFFERENCES FROM quiz-room-auto

This project is a fork of quiz-room-auto with the following fundamental changes:

| Feature | quiz-room-auto | quiz-room-local |
|---------|---------------|----------------|
| Player join | room code + nickname | **nickname only** |
| Room discovery | player enters code | **auto via `/api/current-room`** |
| Concurrent games | multiple rooms | **single active session** |
| Network | internet OK | **LAN-only, offline-capable** |
| Tablet UI | standard browser | **kiosk: fullscreen, auto-reconnect** |
| Host flow | create room → share code → start | **select quiz → Start** |

---

## ARCHITECTURE

### Single-Room Model

The server maintains one `currentActiveRoom` slot. When the host creates a session, it becomes the current room. Tablets call `GET /api/current-room` on load and auto-join if a room exists; otherwise they show "Waiting for host" and poll every 3 seconds.

The room code still exists internally (Socket.IO rooms, session management) but is never shown to players.

### Kiosk Mode (PlayerView)

On load: attempt `requestFullscreen()` on first user interaction.
Auto-reconnect: `socket.on('disconnect')` → exponential backoff reconnect (2s, 4s, 8s, max 30s).
Navigation lock: `window.onbeforeunload = () => ''`, block F5/Backspace/Alt+F4 via `keydown`.
Polling: if no active room, poll `GET /api/current-room` every 3s until one appears.

### State Machine (unchanged from quiz-room-auto)

```
Standard:  WAITING → STARTING → QUESTION → ANSWER_REVEAL → LEADERBOARD → (repeat) → ENDED
Category:  WAITING → STARTING → CATEGORY_SELECT → [1s CATEGORY_CHOSEN] → QUESTION → ...
```

## HTTP API

| Method | Path | Returns |
|--------|------|---------|
| GET | `/health` | `{ status, uptime, activeSessions }` |
| GET | `/api/current-room` | `{ roomCode }` or `{ roomCode: null }` |
| GET | `/api/quizzes` | Quiz list from quizzes/ |
| POST | `/api/quizzes/save` | Save quiz → `{ id, filename }` |
| DELETE | `/api/quizzes/:id` | Delete quiz file |
| GET | `/api/stats` | Aggregated stats + sessions list |
| GET | `/api/stats/session/:id` | Single session details |
| GET | `/api/media/:filename` | Serve local media file |

---

## WebSocket Events

### Client → Server

| Event | Data | Notes |
|-------|------|-------|
| `create-quiz` | `{ quizData, settings }` | Host only — sets currentActiveRoom |
| `join-quiz` | `{ nickname, roomCode? }` | roomCode optional — uses currentActiveRoom if omitted |
| `submit-answer` | `{ answerId: 0-3 }` | |
| `submit-category` | `{ choiceIndex: 0-1 }` | |
| `get-game-state` | `{ roomCode }` | |
| `watch-room` | `{ roomCode }` | Projector observer |
| `host-control` | `{ roomCode, action }` | pause/resume/skip/start |

### Server → Client (`quiz-update` types)

Same as quiz-room-auto: `PLAYER_JOINED`, `PLAYER_LEFT`, `QUIZ_STARTING`, `CATEGORY_SELECT`,
`CATEGORY_CHOSEN`, `NEW_QUESTION`, `ANSWER_COUNT`, `GAME_PAUSED`, `GAME_RESUMED`,
`REVEAL_ANSWER`, `SHOW_LEADERBOARD`, `QUIZ_ENDED`.

New: `NO_ACTIVE_ROOM` — emitted to joining player when no session exists yet.

---

## config.json

```json
{
  "server": { "port": 8080, "host": "0.0.0.0" },
  "quiz": {
    "questionTime": 30,
    "answerRevealTime": 5,
    "leaderboardTime": 5,
    "autoStart": false,
    "waitForAllPlayers": true,
    "minPlayers": 1,
    "maxPlayers": 8,
    "shuffle": false
  },
  "kiosk": {
    "reconnectBaseDelay": 2000,
    "reconnectMaxDelay": 30000,
    "roomPollInterval": 3000
  }
}
```

Note: `autoStart` is `false` — host explicitly presses Start.

---

## SCORING (unchanged from quiz-room-auto)

```
basePoints = 100
timeBonus = max(0, questionTime - answerTime) * 2
playerScore += basePoints + timeBonus   // 0 for wrong
Tiebreaker: avgAnswerTime ascending
```

---

## KNOWN REMAINING WORK

All planned phases (0-6) are complete. The following items were identified post-v0.2.0 but not yet implemented. A new session should read this list before starting any new work.

| # | Item | Priority | Notes |
|---|------|----------|-------|
| 1 | Delete `AdminPanel.jsx` | Low | Route removed in Phase 3, file still on disk — dead code |
| 2 | `ProjectorView` auto-discovers room | High | Currently still asks for room code — should poll `/api/current-room` like PlayerView |
| 3 | `color-mix()` CSS fallback in HostView.css | Medium | Not supported in older Chrome — replace with hardcoded RGBA |
| 4 | Player list in HostView | Medium | Host sees only a count; should show joined player names |
| 5 | Quiz library refresh after game ends | Low | HostView doesn't re-fetch the quiz list after a game completes |
| 6 | "Go to Host Panel" button in QuizCreator | Low | After saving a quiz, add link to `#/host` for smooth flow |
| 7 | `package.json` version is still `0.1.0` | Low | Needs bump to `0.2.0` |
